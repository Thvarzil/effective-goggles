## Effective Googles

EffectiveGoggles is my side project at the moment. I aim to create a CSS library (which will perhaps eventually evolve into a CSS/JS library) that I can use on all future personal and other projects. This file will be strictly a readme, I will add a file for documentation and commentary on the library.

####Intended Features
