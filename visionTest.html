    <p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an

        and that means comfort.</p>

    <p> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an
        oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole,
        and that means comfort.<br/>
        It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact
        middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with
        panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats
        and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into
        the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many little round doors
        opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms,
        cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms,
        all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going
        in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows
        beyond, sloping down to the river.</p>
